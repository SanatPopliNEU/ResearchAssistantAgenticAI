#üìò Agentic System - Technical Documentation
#1. System Architecture
The Agentic System follows a modular, multi-agent architecture designed around orchestration, specialization, and tool integration. The architecture comprises:

A Controller Agent that acts as the central orchestrator

Multiple Specialized Agents with focused responsibilities

Integration with both built-in and custom tools

A dedicated Memory Management Layer

An Orchestration Workflow Engine for sequencing agent actions


#2. Agent Roles and Responsibilities
üì° Controller Agent (controller_agent.py)
Responsibilities:

Coordinates all workflow stages

Delegates tasks to specialized agents

Handles failure cases with fallback strategies

Manages inter-agent communication

Features:

Decision logic based on input context

#Logging and verbose control for debugging

üß† Research Agent (research_agent.py)
Responsibilities:

Performs web search and gathers topic-specific information

Interfaces with web_search_tool.py

Prompt Strategy:

Uses domain-adapted prompts to extract relevant context

‚úçÔ∏è Summarization Agent (summarization_agent.py)
Responsibilities:

Generates concise summaries from retrieved content

Works with data_processing_tool.py and OpenAI API

#Prompt Strategy:

Instruction-tuned for clarity and brevity

#3. Tool Integration
‚úÖ Built-in Tools
Tool Name	Description
web_search_tool.py	Uses an API or simulated search to retrieve online content
data_processing_tool.py	Cleans, parses, and transforms data into structured form
output_formatting_tool.py	Converts raw output into readable formats like Markdown or JSON

üß© Custom Tool
Tool: custom_domain_extractor.py
Purpose: Extracts and highlights domain-specific keywords or entities using regular expressions or NLP logic.

Inputs:

Raw text or search results

Outputs:

JSON with extracted terms and confidence (if scored)

Error Handling:

Handles null/empty text, malformed input, and noisy data gracefully

#4. Orchestration Workflow
Implemented in workflow.py, the orchestration layer supports sequential task execution and manages:

Input validation and pre-processing

Calling agents with contextual memory

Storing intermediary outputs

Triggering fallback steps if agents fail

#5. Memory System
The memory_manager.py module implements:

Ephemeral memory for short-term context sharing across a session

Persistent memory hooks (if extended) for logging past task interactions

In-memory dictionaries as the primary store (extensible to Redis or SQLite)

#6. Implementation Notes
The system entry point is main.py, which takes a task query as input and runs the full agentic workflow.

Dependencies are defined in requirements.txt, supporting Python 3.11.x.

All modules follow separation of concerns and are independently testable.

#7. Testing Strategy
Unit tests are provided in the tests/ folder:

test_controller_agent.py: Workflow and delegation logic

test_specialized_agents.py: Output correctness for agents

test_tools.py: Edge cases and transformation accuracy

test_workflow.py: End-to-end integration tests

#8. Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Pydantic compatibility (v1 vs v2 issues)	Locked compatible versions using requirements.txt
Agent-tool integration failures	Used BaseTool typing and validated tool schemas
Tool output inconsistency	Implemented post-processing and structured return formats
Context loss between agents	Introduced lightweight memory system to retain intermediate data

# 9. Performance Analysis
Metric	Description
Execution Time	Avg. 4.3s per complete research ‚Üí summary cycle
Accuracy	Manually verified correctness ~85% (subjective)
Tool Success Rate	100% for built-in tools with valid input
Error Handling	Graceful failure fallback observed in all tests

## 10. Future Improvements
Add GUI layer for user task input (Streamlit or Gradio)

Extend memory to support long-term project history

Integrate document ingestion pipeline (e.g., PDFs, web pages)

Enhance domain extractor with NLP models (spaCy, Transformers)

#11. Conclusion
The Agentic System demonstrates a robust implementation of multi-agent orchestration using Python, integrating built-in and custom tools. It shows strong potential for scalability, adaptability across domains, and practical use in content summarization and web intelligence gathering.
